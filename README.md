# GroundUp
Building a game in C from the ground up attempting to use only
the standard C library, however certain OS specific libraries may need to be used.

## Why?
WSIWYG tools and game frameworks and libraries are awesome,
and this is not an attempt to replace them or deny their usefulness or even necessity.
However something we believe strongly in understanding things from first principles,
as then one is much more able to solve problems and has knowledge at a deeper level. 
An appreciation of what the frameworks and libraries do and make easier is also gained, and this can also lead to new ideas,
or suggested improvements to the frameworks and libraries.

## Why C?
In the future C++ will probably be the language of development (although we are keen to explore other languages and web based games too). The use of C in this case is for simplicity - although simplicity should not be confused with ease. For the goals of this work, even C++ is too "heavy" - using C will ideally make things more transparent. We also love C, so maybe that has something to do with it!

## Resources
Although a different goal, there is overlap with the goals of Casey Muratori's awesome Handmade Hero project, and that was and remains an inspiration. Be sure to checkout the youtube channel (Handmade Hero), and watch the announcement trailer, its good stuff!

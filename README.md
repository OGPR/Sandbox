# GroundUp
Building a game in C from the ground up attempting to use only
the standard C library, however certain OS specific libraries may need to be used.

## Why?
WSIWYG tools and game frameworks and libraries are awesome,
and this is not an attempt to replace them or deny their usefulness or even necessity.
However something we believe strongly in understanding things from first principles,
as then one is much more able to solve problems and has knowledge at a deeper level. 
An appreciation of what the frameworks and libraries do and make easier is also gained, and this can also lead to new ideas,
or suggested improvements to the frameworks and libraries.
